## WEEKEND - COMPLETE REST

### SATURDAY & SUNDAY: ZERO STRUCTURED TRAINING

**Why rest is non-negotiable:**
- You're training hard 5 days/week
- Only getting 6 hours of sleep (recovery already compromised)
- Muscles grow during REST, not during training
- Prevents overtraining and injury

**What you CAN do:**
- Light walking (30 min)
- Stretching or yoga (20 min)
- Play casually with friends (low intensity, for fun)
- Meal prep for next week
- Watch film (NBA games, study shooting form, ball handling)
- Foam rolling
- Sauna if available

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Structured workouts
- Pickup games (save for your weekly game, schedule it smart)
- "Just a quick shooting session" (NO - rest means rest)
